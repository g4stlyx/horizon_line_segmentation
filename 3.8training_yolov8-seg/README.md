# Using YOLO-seg Models (e.g., YOLOv8-seg) for HLD
YOLO models with segmentation capabilities (like YOLOv5-seg or the more recent YOLOv8-seg) are primarily designed for instance segmentation. This means they detect individual objects and produce a mask for each instance. However, you can cleverly adapt this for your semantic segmentation task.

## How it Works:
You would treat 'sky' and 'non-sky' as two large "instances" that you want to detect and mask.

## Dataset Preparation: 
Your current dataset of images and corresponding binary masks is perfect. You will need to convert these masks into the polygon format that YOLO expects for training. Each image would have one or more polygons defining the 'sky' region and one or more polygons defining the 'non-sky' region. You would assign these polygons to two classes: 0: sky, 1: non-sky.

## Training: 
You would train a YOLO-seg model (e.g., YOLOv8n-seg for speed or YOLOv8x-seg for accuracy) on your prepared dataset with these two classes. The model will learn to identify the shapes and textures associated with the sky and everything else.

### Inference: 
When you run an image through the trained model, it will output detected "objects" with their class, bounding box, and a pixel mask. You would get masks for the 'sky' class and masks for the 'non-sky' class. You can then simply combine all the 'sky' masks to generate your final binary segmentation map.

## Comparison to U-Net:
### Pros:

Speed: YOLO models are heavily optimized for speed and are generally much faster than U-Net architectures, making them ideal for real-time applications (e.g., on an autonomous vessel).

Ease of Use: The Ultralytics framework for YOLOv8 is extremely user-friendly for training, validation, and deployment.

Strong Pre-training: You start with weights pre-trained on the large COCO dataset, which can lead to faster convergence and better generalization.

### Cons:

Architectural Mismatch: You are using an instance segmentation architecture for a semantic segmentation task. While it works, it may not be as precise at the boundary (the horizon line) as a model specifically designed for semantic segmentation like U-Net or a Transformer. The model might struggle with images that have disconnected sky regions.

Potentially Lower Accuracy: For producing a perfectly clean, per-pixel map, a dedicated semantic segmentation architecture might yield slightly better results on metrics like Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), especially along the fine horizon line.
