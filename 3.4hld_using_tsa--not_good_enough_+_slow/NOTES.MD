🔍 Purpose of the Study
* This paper proposes a real-time maritime horizon line detection system that:
* Uses dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) shaped as parallelograms.
* Applies Time Series Models (TSM) to predict and adjust ROI in real time.
* Aims to increase speed (up to 33 FPS) while maintaining high accuracy (<1 px position, <0.1° angle error).

🧠 Core Technical Concepts
1. Programming Tools and Technologies
* Language/Tool Used: MATLAB R2024a
* Library Techniques: Canny edge detection, Radon transform
* GitHub Code: https://github.com/Ahmet-Agaoglu/HL-Detection-using-TSA
* No AI/deep learning training is required in their method (although prior research compared includes CNNs).
    * burası önemli
